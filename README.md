# Barbacoa08 (barbajoe)

I'm also [joe-s-avaya](https://github.com/joe-s-avaya) and one of the primary contirbutors for several of [Avaya's UI Libraries](https://github.com/avaya-dux/), but most notably, the [Neo React Library](https://github.com/avaya-dux/neo-react-library), which is an Accessible React Library for reusable components.

## skills

React+TS are where the majority of my skills lie, but I enjoy learning about new technologies and have been exploring Astro, Svelte, Vite, Vitest (and others) at the time of this writing. I am also passionate about usability and accessbility, and am in the process of acquiring an Accessibility Certification through [the Accessibility Association](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certification).

## older projects

[barbie meals](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbie-meals): is/was my response to recipe sites having **_so many_** ads! Plus, although there are _many_ ways to store recipies, this gave me an excuse to play with some tech I hadn't previously; such as [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), [reactn](https://github.com/CharlesStover/reactn), and others.

[death graphs](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/death-graphs): I was curious about COVID deaths in comparison to previous deaths by year, so I built this app really quickly to play with the data. I abandoned it after a few months due to _many_ other people having the same idea. I also don't use graphs often, so I've kept this around as a reminder of how to build/use graphs.

## throw-away projects

[electron example](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/electron-example): I read about Electron and wanted to build a minimal app for my Mac and PC with React tech.

[hackernews with React and Apollo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/hackernews-react-apollo): GraphQL is absolutely wonderful tech, but I rarely get to play with it in my day job, so I followed this tutorial to gain some more knowledge about it.

[trains graph](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/trains-graph): I wanted to play with `react-graph-vis`, and had read an article on weighted graphs, so I threw this together.

[rest countries](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/rest-countries): NASA has several openly available API's, but their [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) is _so cool_! So I threw this together to play with it.
