# barbajoe

I'm also [joe-s-avaya](https://github.com/joe-s-avaya) and one of the primary contributors for several of [Avaya's UI Libraries](https://github.com/avaya-dux/), but most notably, the [Neo React Library](https://github.com/avaya-dux/neo-react-library), which is an Accessible React Library for reusable components.

## skills

Svelte(Kit), TypeScript, and React are where the majority of my skills lie. I enjoy learning about new technologies and have, at the time of this writing, been exploring Astro, Tauri, Rust, Vite, Vitest, and Ionic's Capacitor. I am also passionate about usability and accessbility, and am in the process of acquiring an Accessibility Certification through [the Accessibility Association](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certification).

## recent projects

### Person to Place ([GitHub link](https://github.com/barbacoa08/person-to-place/))

This is a desktop app for keeping track of where people live. I created this due to working for a global company and being unable to find any other solution that did what I wanted. Plus, I wanted an excuse to play with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

_Tech Used_: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), Rust, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Vite, CSS, PNPM, Cargo, ESLint, Prettier, JavaScript, ESM, GitHub, GitHub Actions

### Fighter Advice ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/fighter-advice), [Live Site](https://fighter-advice.barbajoe.tech/), [CMS](https://cms-fighter-advice.barbajoe.tech/admin))

This is an advice site for amateur fighters. I compile advice and helpful content and occasionally post my thoughts about training and the life of a fighter.

_Tech Used_: [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/), [Northflank](https://northflank.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), Express, MongoDB, NoSQL, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Vite, CSS, PNPM, Cargo, ESLint, Prettier, JavaScript, ESM, GitHub, GitHub Actions

### barbajoe ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe), [Live Site](https://barbajoe.tech/))

This is my exploration into a mono-repo with multiple dependencies. It contains several repositories including, but not limited to, a small Astro app ([barbajoe.tech](https://barbajoe.tech/)), an [Astro Library Staging page](https://lib-staging.barbajoe.tech/), a pure [CSS Library](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/css-lib), a [Svelte Library](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/svelte-lib), and a [React Library](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbajoe/tree/main/src/packages/react-lib). All of these have a GitHub Action that auto-publishes them whenever their version is updated. I utilize the libraries in all of my new projects and regularly update them as I find a reason to.

_Tech Used_: [Astro](https://astro.build/), Netlify, ReactJS, Svelte, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Vite, CSS, PNPM, ESLint, Prettier, JavaScript, ESM, GitHub, GitHub Actions

### Cat Emotions ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/cat-emotions), [Live Site](https://cat-emotions.barbajoe.tech/))

This is the outcome of me learning how to clearly express my emotions. Because a picture is worth a thousand words, and cats are exceptionally expressive. The app also allows you to track your emotions over time, and having that history is something that I found helpful to look back on.

_Tech Used_: ReactJS, [Charka UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), Hasura, PostgreSQL, Netlify, TypeScript, react-scripts, CSS, Yarn, ESLint, Prettier, JavaScript, ESM, GitHub, GitHub Actions

## older projects

[Barbacoa08](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/Barbacoa08): I discovered how to personalize my github account, so I had to play with it!

[barbie meals](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/barbie-meals): is/was my response to recipe sites having **_so many_** ads! Plus, although there are _many_ ways to store recipies, this gave me an excuse to play with some tech I hadn't previously; such as [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), [reactn](https://github.com/CharlesStover/reactn), and others.

[death graphs](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/death-graphs): I was curious about COVID deaths in comparison to previous deaths by year, so I built this app really quickly to play with the data. I abandoned it after a few months due to _many_ other people having the same idea. I also don't use graphs often, so I've kept this around as a reminder of how to build/use graphs.

## throw-away projects

[electron example](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/electron-example): I read about Electron and wanted to build a minimal app for my Mac and PC with React tech.

[hackernews with React and Apollo](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/hackernews-react-apollo): GraphQL is absolutely wonderful tech, but I rarely get to play with it in my day job, so I followed this tutorial to gain some more knowledge about it.

[trains graph](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/trains-graph): I wanted to play with `react-graph-vis`, and had read an article on weighted graphs, so I threw this together.

[rest countries](https://github.com/Barbacoa08/rest-countries): NASA has several openly available API's, but their [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) is _so cool_! So I threw this together to play with it.
